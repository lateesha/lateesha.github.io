  <h1>You Are Here: Reflections on Week 1 of Phase 0</h1>
  <h2></h2>
  <h4>Sunday, January 18, 2015</h4>

      First a confession. I'm a staff member at DBC, and this is my second attempt at Phase 0. My initial foray into the role of eager student was thrawted by the realization that I wasn't the least bit prepared for the actual commitment it would take to get through this work. The irony of dropping out of Phase 0 in the first week because I couldn't find the time to fully engage, given that my role as Admissions Manager was to adequately communicate to prospective students what the student experience at Dev Bootcamp would look like, was not lost on me. This time, I decided things would be different.

      So, here I am, frantically finishing my last few challenges an hour before their due on the FIRST week. Like a highly caffinated college freshman, who even after being thouroughly warned about time management and workload is still waiting to the last minute to submit that first paper, I too am at my kitchen table banging this out. Here's a few things I've learned this week that I plan to apply going forward.

      1. You know more than you think you do: I've actually been dabbling for a little over a year now, and completing this first weeks curriculum has given me even more confidence in my ability to keep up with, mentor and be mentored by my cohortmates.

      2. Create space: If I'm committed to completing these 9 weeks on-time, I need to get serious about optimizing my schedule and making this work a priority. The first few challenges on time management were so helpful in creating actionable strategies.

      3. My pace is the right pace: I've got nothing to prove and everything to learn and create during this process. This is easy to say in the first week (shit really hits the fan in week 2) but I'm not worried about trying to meet anyone else's expectations but my own. Meduium paced typing be damned!

      4. Trust the process: It helps that I share an office with the writer of this curriculum. All of this content was created with a specific end goal in mind. We're encouraged to take an active role in our learning and the consumption of this curriculum, but that doesn't mean to only do 50% of what is asked of you because you believe another topic is more important. So, I'm declaring now that I will complete every challenge, no matter how tedious, because I'm anxious to see where this path leads, and the developer I'll become at the end of it.
